What is Solar360 Doing?
Solar360 is our all-in-one smart solar ecosystem. We're not just building a tool — we're building a movement to empower India with smarter, greener, and more cost-effective solar solutions.

At the Future Design Hackathon, here’s what we’re working on:

🚀 Our Goal:
To revolutionize the solar energy experience in India using smart tools, real-time data, AI, and government integration — making solar energy more accessible, educational, and impactful for every Indian.

🛠️ What We’re Building:
1. Solar AI
Optimizes solar panel placement using AI + geolocation + roof analysis.

4. EcoMeter
Tracks environmental impact of your solar use.

CO₂ saved, trees equivalent, energy offset.

Visual dashboard + shareable green badge.

5. AgriSolar
Smart solar irrigation & farming assistant.

Weather prediction + water need estimator.

Auto-start solar pumps + crop-based water analytics.

6. SolarEd
Teaches India everything about solar in simple terms.
